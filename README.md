# arcpyloader
Loads the correct arcgisscripting DLL for ArcPy to function when relaunched from within another Python scripts.

> ðŸ›‘ **Deprecated**  
> The arcpyloader was written for ArcMap which is now nearing end of life. Consider using ArcGIS Pro instead, which does not need this tool as it is entriely 64-bit.

---

Under certain circumstances, importing ArcPy while using Python multiprocessing will result in an error like:
```
DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
```

This is caused by the sub-process attempting to load the wrong version of the arcgisscripting DLL (e.g. loading the x86 version in a x64 environment).

This mainly occurs in ArcGIS Desktop with background processing installed.

The *arcpyloader* file will adjust paths before loading ArcPy ensuring that the correct version of ArcPy is loaded.

## Use
Place the *arcpyloader.py* file in the same directory as your code and use the following code to import ArcPy:
```python
from  arcpyloader  import arcpy
```
